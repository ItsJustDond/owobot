~
~ Steps to set up the bot
~
~ Step 1: make a bot on the developers website. Make sure you are logged in on the correct account on your browser and go to this link: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ 
~ Then click on New Application on the top right. Choose a name for the application.
~
~ Step 2: make your application into a bot. Click on "bot" on the left, then click on "Add Bot". Again, choose a name for your bot.
~
~ Step 3: inviting your bot. Copy the ID of your bot and go to the following website: "https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#0" when there, put in your ID and the permissions
~ you want to give it. When that's done, click on the link it gives you on the bottom left.
~ Step 4: getting some important stuff. I advice you to open a notepad now and put the things in there. First of all, copy the "Token" on the "Bot" tab. It is important that you
~ don't share this with ANYONE. Next find out what the ID of your account is. You can do this by right clicking your profile and clicking "copy ID". This will only work if you have Developer Mode* Enabled
~ 
~ Step 5: setting up the JSON. Now we got our important stuff, open the "important.json" file in a code editor**. Where it says "ENTER_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE", enter the token you found earlier.
~ Where it says "ENTER_YOUR_ID_HERE", enter *your* ID. Where it says "ENTER_YOUR_PREFIX_HERE". Choose a prefix***.
~ Once that's done, you're done with setting up.
~
~ Step 6: "finding" the bot. In order to run the bot open your Command Prompt and navigate to your bot folder. EXAMPLE: if your bot is on your desktop, in the command prompt, type "cd {next folder to navigate to}".
~ Let's say the bot is on the desktop, and to get to my desktop I need to go through the following path: "C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\MyBot". Simply type "CD {The_Next_Folder}" until you are at the bot folder.
~
~ Step 7: running the bot. When you are in the correct folder, simply type "node index.js". 
~
~ Step 8: using the bot. Currently there are 6 commands:
~ - delch - when running this command the bot will delete all channels it can delete.
~ - nuke - when running this command the bot will ban all members it can ban.
~ - ping - when running this command the bot will say "pong" (this a good command to test if your bot works).
~ - roles - when running this command the bot will add roles called "oof" until the roles are maxed out.
~ - delrole - when running this command the bot will delete all roles it can delete.
~ - say - when running this command the bot will say whatever comes after "say".
